For this project we were tasked with creating a personal portfolio webpage that list 3 projects as cards.

## Description

The cards for the projects had to have a screenshot of the project and a link to the GutHub repo for that project. I choose to use a design that I have used for my personal portfolio and adapt that to this delivery.
